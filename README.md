## A lightweight in-browser code playground for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Type on the left, see changes live on the rightâ€”no setup required. You can add CDN links to try libraries on the fly, and a Format button cleans up your code with one click.

## Features

- Live preview: Instant feedback as you edit HTML, CSS, and JS.

- CDN support: Quickly attach external libraries by URL.

- One-click formatting: Keep your code readable and consistent.

- Zero config: Open the page and start coding.

## How to Use

- Click Run (or rely on auto-update if enabled) to refresh the preview.

- Use Add CDN to include frameworks or utilities.

- Hit Format anytime to tidy your code.
