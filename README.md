# 📓Simple Web Editor

## A lightweight in-browser code playground for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Type on the left, see changes live on the right—no setup required. You can add CDN links to try libraries on the fly, and a Format button cleans up your code with one click.
* File upload / multi-file support is on the roadmap and will be added later.

## Features

- Live preview: Instant feedback as you edit HTML, CSS, and JS.

- CDN support: Quickly attach external libraries by URL.

- One-click formatting: Keep your code readable and consistent.

- Zero config: Open the page and start coding.

## How to Use

- Write or paste your HTML, CSS, and JS into each panel.

- Click Run (or rely on auto-update if enabled) to refresh the preview.

- Use Add CDN to include frameworks or utilities.

- Hit Format anytime to tidy your code.
